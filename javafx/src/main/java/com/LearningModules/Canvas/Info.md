The JavaFX Canvas control provides a graphical canvas you can draw graphics on using drawing commands in the form of method calls.

The JavaFX Canvas control is very similar in design and function to the HTML Canvas.
- Canvas control can be used to draw graphics at a higher performance than composing graphics using JavaFX 2D shapes attached to the scene graph, so if you need higher performance graphics, the JavaFX control is the way to go.
